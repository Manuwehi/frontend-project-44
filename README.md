Hello! This is my first pet-project - a couple of console-games.
You can run them by typing "brain-<game-name>" - there is a 6 (5, one of them is just welcome-func) different games.
They will challenge your math abilities - sum, multy, div.
You can change game difficulty by changing variables in the getRandomNum function.
For install games, please fork this repo and use 'make install'
